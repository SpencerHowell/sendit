# Send It to Your Senators
This is a web app that automatically looks up the United States Senators that correspond to the state that you are currently in. Information is then displayed about each Senator, including political party, social media links, biography, and a page to contact them directly. The user can also input another state's name at the bottom of the page to learn more about that state's Senators.

Our hope is that this website makes it easier for the average citizen to learn about their Senators and their positions. It also allows citizens to easily contact their Senators, increasing political engagement.

This website is implemented with a Python Flask webapp, along with HTML and CSS files utilizing Bootstrap.
